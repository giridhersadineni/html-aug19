            <p>The school strike for climate (Swedish: Skolstrejk för klimatet), also known variously as Fridays for Future (FFF), Youth for Climate and Youth Strike 4 Climate, is an international movement of school students who take time off from class to participate in demonstrations to demand action to prevent further global warming and climate change. Publicity and widespread organising began after Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg staged a protest in August 2018 outside the Swedish Riksdag (parliament), holding a sign that read "Skolstrejk för klimatet" ("School strike for the climate").[3][4]</p>
            <p>School strike for Climate have announced two global strikes for September 2019:[81] the 20 September Climate Strike, three days before a UN emergency climate summit being held in New York,[82] and the Earth Strike over the full week from 20 to 27 September. The group 350.org is active in organising these. PBS pointed out that 27 September 2019 is the anniversary of the publication of Silent Spring in 1962.[83] Individual countries and cities may organise strikes for one or both dates, depending on relevant factors, for example, New Zealand will have a national strike on the 27th, and not on the 20th, with over 36 towns and cities participating.[84]

                    Organisers hope these strikes will have the largest turnout of any climate strikes thus far, by including labourers, office workers, university students, retired people, etc. in addition to the school students that led previous strikes.[81] Many NGOs, unions, social movements, and companies have expressed support for the strikes,[85] including 350.org, Amnesty International, Extinction Rebellion, Greenpeace International, Oxfam, WWF, Patagonia,[86] Ben & Jerry's, Lush,[87] Atlassian,[88] and more. New York City public schools have announced plans to "excuse students to participate in climate strikes", with parents' permission.[89] Some Australian companies have formed the "Not Business As Usual alliance",[90] and have encouraged their workers to join the strikes in their respective cities, and advocate for all Australian companies to support taking climate action. In the United Kingdom, the UK General Strike for Climate, planned for 20 September, will be the first general strike in Britain since the 1926 United Kingdom general strike.
                    
                    Organisers of the 20 September protests reported that over 4 million people participated in strikes worldwide,[2] including 1.4 million participants in Germany and 300000 protesters in Australia.[91][92]</p>
